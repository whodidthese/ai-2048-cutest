# AI 2048 Cutest

A cute, mobile-friendly implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game with pastel aesthetics, random nickname generation, and an online/offline leaderboard system.

**This project is entirely generated by Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, including this README.MD file.**

## ✨ Features

* **Classic 2048 Gameplay:** Slide tiles and merge identical numbers to reach the 2048 tile (and beyond!).
* **Cute Aesthetics:** Features a user-friendly UI with pastel colors and cute, readable fonts.
* **Mobile Optimized:** Designed primarily for mobile browsers in portrait mode, with swipe controls. Keyboard controls (arrow keys) are also supported.
* **Random Nickname Generation:** Generates fun, random nicknames (e.g., "Dancing Pink Cupcake") for the leaderboard using combinations of `<Action><Color><CuteAnimal/Dessert>`. Allows regeneration if the user desires.
* **Server-Side Leaderboard:** A Node.js backend using Express and SQLite stores the top 10 scores globally.
* **Offline Fallback Leaderboard:** If the server is unavailable, the game seamlessly switches to storing and displaying a Top 10 leaderboard locally using browser Local Storage.

## 🚀 Server Installation(Optional)

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/whodidthese/ai-2048-cutest.git
    cd ai-2048-cutest
    ```

2.  **Install server dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.sample .env
        ```
    * Edit the `.env` file and set the desired `PORT` for the server (e.g., `PORT=3330`).

4.  **Run the backend server:**
    * While still in the `server` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * The server should start, typically on `http://localhost:3330` (or the port you specified). You'll see log messages confirming the database connection and server start.

## 🎮 How to Play

* Use your **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) or **swipe** on a touch screen to move the tiles.
* When two tiles with the same number touch, they **merge into one** tile with double the value!
* A new tile (either '2' or '4') appears randomly on an empty spot after each move.
* The goal is to create a tile with the number **2048**.
* The game ends when there are no empty spots left on the grid and no possible merges.
* After the game ends, confirm your randomly generated nickname (or regenerate it) and click "Confirm & Submit" to save your score to the leaderboard (online or local).
